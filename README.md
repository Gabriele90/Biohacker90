Cheminformatics (sometimes referred to as chemical informatics or chemoinformatics) focuses on storing, indexing, searching, retrieving, and applying information about chemical compounds.  In addition to chemical names and formulas, cheminformatics specialists search for and retrieve information about physical properties, three-dimensional molecular and crystal structures, spectroscopic signatures, chemical reaction pathways, molecular functional groups and docking sites, and other parameters, some of which require advanced information storage and retrieval technologies. In those projects I explored different regression and classification algorithms to assess molecule properties and features like solubility, toxicity and molecular docking.
